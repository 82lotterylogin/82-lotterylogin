                    <ul class="list-features">
                        <li><strong>ID Check</strong>: You'll need to show proof like an Aadhaar or passport. Verification takes about ten minutes, and it ensures your account is legitimate.</li>
                        <li><strong>Minimum Amount</strong>: Cash-outs start at ₹1,600 for e-wallets, ₹4,150 for bank transfers. This keeps costs low for everyone.</li>
                        <li><strong>Limits</strong>: Caps like ₹4,00,000 daily for banks prevent fraud. Plan big withdrawals over a few days.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fees</strong>: Some methods charge a bit, like ₹80 for bank transfers. Check before you confirm.</li>

                    <ul class="list-features">
                        <li><strong>Quick Payouts</strong>: E-wallets hit your account in a day or two, per 82 Lottery's June 2025 rules.</li>
                        <li><strong>Safe as Houses</strong>: SSL encryption and 2FA lock your money tight, backed by a 2025 Gartner report.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lots of Options</strong>: Pick bank transfers, PayPal, or Bitcoin—whatever suits you.</li>
